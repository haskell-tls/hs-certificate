--
-- Exposes helpers for X509 certificate and revocation list, signed structures.
--
-- Signed structures are of the form:
--      Sequence {
--          object              a
--          signatureAlgorithm  AlgorithmIdentifier
--          signatureValue      BitString
--      }
--
-- Unfortunately as lots of signed objects published have been signed on an
-- arbitrary BER ASN1 encoding (instead of using the unique DER encoding) or in
-- a non-valid DER implementation, we need to keep the raw data being signed,
-- as we can't recompute the bytestring used to sign for non compliant cases.
--
-- Signed represent the pure data type for compliant cases, and SignedExact
-- the real world situation of having to deal with compliant and non-compliant cases.
